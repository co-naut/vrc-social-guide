  While I may not know VRChat inside and out, I still want to share some of my insights. Discussion features are under development, so if you have something to say, you can join our Discord server or submit a PR.

## About This Project
{{<card>}}
Hello! I'm an ordinary VRChat player. After about 500 hours in VRChat, I've realized that social patterns in VRChat are very different from real life. The anonymity brought by its virtual nature and the near-real-life conversation and interaction experience create a wonderful chemistry, making the social experience in VRChat unique and nuanced. So I created this simple website, hoping to share some observations and thoughts about virtual socializing here.

This project is just getting started--I hope this can become a space where everyone shares experiences and helps each other, thus gaining a better social experience in VRChat.
