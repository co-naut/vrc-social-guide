## About This Project
Hello! I'm a VRChat player with around 500 hours of experience. I've noticed that social interactions in VRChat work very differently from real life.

The virtual world offers anonymity while still feeling like genuine conversation. This combination creates something unique - a social experience that's both familiar and completely new. I built this website to share observations about virtual socializing. My goal is to help people navigate and enjoy VRChat's social landscape.

This project is just beginning. I hope it becomes a space where we can share experiences and learn from each other.
