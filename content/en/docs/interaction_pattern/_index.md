# VR vs Reality

## How is social interaction on VRChat different from reality?

### Characteristics of Real-life Social Interaction

Let's first analyze real-life social interaction:

From birth, a person exists within social relationships. As they grow up, their social relationships gradually expand outward. This process is **centralized and slow**, because the most efficient way to expand relationships in real life is actually to connect with friends of friends, or to join a group and expand relationships through that group.

The characteristics of this relationship extension model are obvious - **stable, easier to build deep relationships, but limited in social breadth**. Additionally, relationship management in real life is often more cautious.

Furthermore, appearance and physical conditions, wealth, and various external factors also influence the establishment of social relationships in real life. Even socializing itself may take on some utilitarian and functional aspects, losing some of its purity.

### VRChat's Unique Characteristics

Create a new account, and you are a pure outsider who is "beyond the three realms and not within the five elements." New players (unless brought into the game by friends) have no connection to any person or group in VRChat.

This kind of beginning gives players a completely new option: continuously seeking out strangers and chatting with them to become friends.
